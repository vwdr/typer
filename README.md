# Auto Typing Program

This program automatically types out the content of a text file onto the active window, with a configurable delay between each character. Additionally, it periodically performs certain actions such as moving the cursor to specific locations and playing a sound.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pynput
- playsound
- pyautogui
- tkinter

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pynput playsound pyautogui
```

## Usage

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Run the program by executing `python <filename>.py` in your terminal.
3. Click the "Quit" button to stop the program.
4. The program will automatically start typing the content of the `text.txt` file after a 5-second delay.
5. You can customize the typing speed and other parameters in the code.

## Important Note

- Make sure to have a `text.txt` file in the same directory as the program, containing the text you want to type out.
